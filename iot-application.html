    <h2> Activity 1 IoT applications: </h2>
    <h3> a. What is an IoT application? </h3>
    <p>An IoT application or Internet of Things are applications which are used to control the hardware through the use
        of a simple interface build using web technologies such as python, html, css, js etc.
        Through this application the user is able to analyse and monitor sensor data.</p>

        5. Appliance monitor and controller </p>

    <h2>Activity 2 Smart Building </h2>
    <h3> a. What does smart mean? </h3>
    <p>Smart building refers to a building which is automated to a certain extent in order to reduce human effort and
        control appliances using an interface while also covering faults that may occur during the whole process.
        It also covers resource conservation, security and health of the users. </p>

    <h3>b. What are the main Features needed? </h3>
    <p> 1. Data handling: data security, data backup, data access restriction
        2. Sensor data precision and accuracy
        3. Realtime health monitoring
        4. Fault notifying system
        5. Health preserving
        6. Connectivity
        7. Abstraction
        8. Automation
    </p>

    <h3>c. What are some Smart-building scenarios</h3>
    <p>1. Security (Intruder detection)
        2. Congestion avoidance detection
        3. Air quality monitoring and ventilation
        4. Turning on and off appliances automatically based on its usage hence saving electricity.
        5. Contactless appliances
        6. Smart Evacuation systems</p>
